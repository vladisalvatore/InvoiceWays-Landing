			<h1>Why Mobile Estimates Beat Word Docs in 2025</h1>
			<p className="subtitle">
				Faster approvals, fewer errors & happier clients
			</p>
		</header>

		<section>
			<h2>1. Win Jobs With Lightning‑Fast Turnaround</h2>
			<p>
				In 2025, homeowners and commercial clients expect quotes{" "}
				<strong>within minutes</strong>, not days. Generating an
				estimate on your phone while you are still on‑site means your
				proposal lands in the client’s inbox before your competitors
				even reach their truck.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>2. Professional Look—No Manual Formatting</h2>
			<p>
				Mobile estimating tools offer branded templates, automatic
				totals and tax calculations, and PDF export in a tap. Word docs
				require copy‑pasting, manual table edits, and font tweaking—time
				you could spend winning the next job.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>3. Real‑Time Sync & Collaboration</h2>
			<p>
				Need your office manager to double‑check numbers? Estimates
				created in Invoice Ways sync instantly with the cloud, so your
				team can review or edit from any device without emailing bulky
				attachments.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>4. Built‑in Pricing Accuracy</h2>
			<p>
				Item libraries, markup presets, and live tax rates remove
				spreadsheet errors that creep into Word. Less re‑typing means
				fewer embarrassing revisions and change orders.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>5. One‑Tap Client Approval & Payment</h2>
			<p>
				Clients tap “Approve” right inside the estimate and can pay a
				deposit immediately. No more printing, signing, scanning, and
				emailing Word attachments.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>6. Seamless Record‑Keeping & Compliance</h2>
			<p>
				Mobile estimates are automatically filed alongside invoices,
				photos, and change orders, making tax time and warranty claims
				painless—and paper‑free.
