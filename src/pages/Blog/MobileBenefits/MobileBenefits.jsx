							<p>
								If you’re a contractor or freelancer, chances
								are you’ve lost valuable hours juggling paper
								receipts, desktop spreadsheets, and late-night
								email threads just to stay on top of estimates
								and invoices. A dedicated{" "}
								<strong>
									mobile invoicing and estimating app
								</strong>{" "}
								puts that entire workflow in your
								pocket—streamlining client communication,
								accelerating cash flow, and freeing you to focus
								on the job itself.
							</p>
						</section>

						<h2>1. Work from Anywhere (Even the Jobsite)</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>On-the-go quoting:</strong> create
								accurate estimates the moment a prospect asks,
								whether you’re climbing a ladder, meeting at a
								café, or chatting on Zoom.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Instant updates:</strong> make change
								orders or price tweaks on-site, preventing
								costly miscommunication later.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>No office required:</strong> all you
								need is your phone—perfect for solopreneurs and
								small crews without a dedicated admin team.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>2. Look More Professional, Win More Work</h2>
						<p>
							A polished PDF estimate with your logo, itemized
							costs, and clear payment terms beats a text-message
							price quote every time. Mobile apps automatically
							apply branding, consistent formatting, and legal
							disclaimers—solidifying trust and positioning you
							above DIY competitors.
						</p>

						<table className={styles.compare}>
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th>Traditional Workflow</th>
									<th>Mobile Workflow with Invoice Ways</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>
										Finish job → drive home → open laptop →
										draft invoice → email client → wait for
										mailed check
									</td>
									<td>

							rates, and A/R aging reports help you refine pricing
							and forecast busy seasons.

							two-factor authentication plus role-based
							permissions keep sensitive info locked down.

							licenses. Invoice Ways starts you with{" "}
